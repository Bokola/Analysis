## Part 1

Q1: Design weights are implemented prior to sampling of observations to ensure the resulting sample is as representative of the population as possible; while post-stratification weights are used at analysis to re-adjust the resulting sample within each strata if there is reason to believe it is not representative of the population

## Part 2

Q1 

```{r}
mod1 <- glmer(
  memberships ~ female+ age + protestant + (1|region) + age*female, data = dat2_1, family = poisson(link = "log")
)
names(summary(mod1))
out1 <- summary(mod1)$coef %>% as.data.frame() 
knitr::kable(out1, format = "pandoc")
```

Q2

There is a significant effect for age*gender interaction. Protestants tend to be more enlisted than non- protestants, also significant. A significant increasing effect of age on membership.

Effect for age in males is coefficient of age : 0.0792
Effect for age on females: 0.0793 - 0.0815 (interaction effect)

Q3

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
mod2 <- glmer(
  memberships ~ female+ age + protestant + (female|region) + age*female, data = dat2_1, family = poisson(link = "log")
)
```

Q4 

Overdispersion occurs in families where variance and mean are related like the poisson, binomial. It is when the variance is too big to be estimated by the model as is. One can try using a different distribution or scaling the standard errors using a different dist.
