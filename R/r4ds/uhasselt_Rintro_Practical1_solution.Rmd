# Introduction

The practical sessions are a collection of exercises about selected topics that were discussed in the course. You will receive information by email about the submission date of the solution. Solution should be submitted in a <tt>Rmd</tt> file. 

# The NHANES data

In many practical sessions the NHANES dataset (the R object <tt> NHANES$</tt>) will be used. The NHANES dataset consists of data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Study. Information about 76 variables is available for 10000 subjects included in the study. Note that you need to install the package <tt>NHANES</tt>.



Variables names are listed below.


```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(chunk_option1 = TRUE)
names(NHANES)
```

# Practical session 1: sampling from a population


In this practical session we use the <tt>NHANES</tt> as a population of 10000 individuals. Useful R functions for this parctical sessions include:

 * <tt>sample()</tt>.
 * <tt> na.omit()</tt>.
 
## The mean and variance weight in the population

 * Calculate the mean, median and the variance of the weight.

### Solution

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(chunk_option1 = TRUE)
mean(na.omit(NHANES$Weight))
median(na.omit(NHANES$Weight))
var(na.omit(NHANES$Weight))
```


## The mean and variance weight in the population

 * Draw 5 samples of size 500 from the population. For each sample calculate the mean and the variance    and plot the histogram for the sample. 
 * Use the R function <tt>qqnorm</tt> normality.
 

### Solution

Example of one sample:
 
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(chunk_option1 = TRUE)
set.seed(123)
drawn = vector('list', 5)
mu = vector("double", 5)
var = vector("double", 5)
for(i in 1:5){
  drawn[[i]] = NHANES[sample(nrow(NHANES), 500),]
  x = drawn[[i]]
  mu[[i]] = mean(x$Weight, na.rm = T)
  var[[i]] = var(x$Weight, na.rm = T)
  qqnorm(x$Weight, na.rm = T)
  
}
print(mu)
print(var)

```

## Correlation

 * Calculate the population correlation between weight and Height.
 * Draw 5 samples of weight and Height (size 100) from the population and calculate the sample   
   correlation.
 * Produce a scatterplot, per sample for weight and Height.
 
 
### Solution
 
  
```{r}
# data without missing values
xx<-data.frame(NHANES$Height,NHANES$Weight)
dim(xx)
xx1<-na.omit(xx)
dim(xx1)
names(xx1)<-c("Height","Weight")
plot(xx1$Height,xx1$Weight)
```


```{r}
#one sample
n<-9634
index<-c(1:n)
index.i<-sample(index,size=100,replace=FALSE)
y<- xx1$Height[index.i]
x<- xx1$Weight[index.i]
cor(x,y)
plot(x,y)
```




## BMI

  * The BMI is define as:
  \[
  MBI= \frac{weight}{height^2}.
  \]
  
  Calculate the individual MBI in the 5 samples and plot the BMI versus the subject age.
  

### Solution
 
All subjects: 
 
```{r}
# data without missing values
xx<-data.frame(NHANES$Height,NHANES$Weight,NHANES$Age)
dim(xx)
xx1<-na.omit(xx)
dim(xx1)
names(xx1)<-c("Height","Weight","Age")
BMI.1<-xx1$Weight/((xx1$Height/100)^2)
plot(xx1$Age,BMI.1)
```  
  
Random sample of 100 subjects:  

```{r}
#one sample
n<-9634
index<-c(1:n)
index.i<-sample(index,size=100,replace=FALSE)
y<- xx1$Height[index.i]
x<- xx1$Weight[index.i]
Age.i<-xx1$Age[index.i]
BMI.1i<-BMI.1<-x/((y/100)^2)
plot(Age.i,BMI.1i)
```

# Practical session 10: using a <tt>for loop </tt>

The following practical session was proposed by Omer Sercik. \newline

## Sampling from $N(0,1)

The following practical session was proposed by Omer Sercik. \newline

During the lecture, we generated a random sample which has a standard normal distribution, meaning mean = 0 and variance = 1. When you calculate the mean and the variance of this sample, say x, we don't get exactly 0 and 1 for the mean and variance, respectively. 

* Draw a random sample of size 25 from $N(0,1)$. Plot the histogram and density estimate and calculate the mean and variance.
* Draw 100 random samples of size 25 from $N(0,1)$, for each sample, calculate the sample mean and variance. Plot a histogram for the sample mean and variance and add a vertical line with the true values.
* Draw random sample of size 5,10,25,50,100,200,500 and 1000 form $N(0,1)$. For each sample size draw 100 random samples. For each sample calculate the mean and variance. Produce a boxplot in which you plot the sample means for each sample size (in the same figure). Do the same for the variance.
