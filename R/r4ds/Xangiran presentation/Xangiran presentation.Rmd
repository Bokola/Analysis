# Heading 1
There are several heading levels. 

## Heading 2
depending on your hierarchy

maybe some latex math? 
$$\large x = \frac{y}{z} $$

And some **bold** and  _italics_ text? 

Three dashes make a new slide
---
# Add some R code
```{r}
plot(mtcars$mpg)
```

---

# Create two columns and mute the R code

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=F}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, cyl)) +
  geom_point()
```
]

.pull-right[
This text goes in the right-hand column, while the plot is placed in the left-hand column
]

class: red, middle, center

# You can also have some special slides
## by specifying classes right after the `---`

---
class: red

# and make lists

- something  
- something more

1. numbered lists
1. number two list

---
class: black, middle

# a black slide with middle centering


---
class: black

# or even with a black slide!
because black is cool, right?

---
layout: false
class: title-slide

# or the title-slide again as a section separator
adding `layout: false` cancels the logo for all slides following it

---
layout: true
<div class="logo"></div> 

<!-- Re-add logo by adding a blank slide with this content -->
---

But it can be re-added  using a black slide with 
```bash
layout: true
<div class="logo"></div> 
```

at the top.
