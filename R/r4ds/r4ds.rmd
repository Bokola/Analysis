## Tibbles with tibble
```{r}
# creating tibbles by coercion
as_tibble(iris)
# creating a new tible from individual vectors with tibble()
tibble(x = 1:5, y = 1, z = x^2+y)
# it's possible for a tibble to have nonsyntactic col names
tb <- tibble(`:)` = "smile", ` ` = "space", `2000` = "number"); tb
# width = Inf prints all cols
nycflights13::flights %>% print(n = 10, width = Inf)
# control default print behaviour by setting options 
# 1) options(tibble.print_max = n, tibble.print_min = m) : if more than m rows, print only n rows. Use options(dplyr.print_min = Inf) to always print all columns, regardless of the width of the screen
# 2) Use options(tibble.width = Inf) to always print all columns regardless of the width of the screen
# Use Rstudio's View() for a scrollable view of the complete dataset

nycflights13::flights %>% View()
# Subsetting ----
# use $ and [[. [[ can extract by both name and position, $ extracts by name only
df <- tibble(x = runif(5), y = runif(5))
# extract by name 
df$x
df[["x"]]
# extract by position
df[[2]] # extracts y
# to use these in a pipe, you'll nedd to use the special placeholder .:
df %>% .$x
df %>% .[["x"]]

```
## Data Import with readr
```{r}
# read_csv() and read_csv2() - for comma and semicolon sep
# read_delim() for files with any delimiter
# read_fwf() - fixed widths -- specify fields with fwf_widths() or their position with fwf_positions()
# read_log() reads Apache style log files. 

# Parsing() ----
# the parse_*() functions are uniform; the first argument is a character vector to parse, and the na argument specifies strins to be specified as missing
parse_integer(c("123", "1","567","."), na = ".")
# if parsing fails you'll get a warning
x <- parse_integer(c("123", "345","abc", "123.56"))
# if there are many parsing failures, use problems() to get complete set
problems(x)
# dealing with , in place of . for dec
parse_double("1,23", locale = locale(decimal_mark = ","))
# parse_number() ignores non-numeric characters
parse_number(" i am %10 years to postdoc")
parse_number("123'456'789", locale = locale(grouping_mark = "'"))

# Strings ----
# we need to first understand how comps represent strings using charToRaw()
charToRaw("basil")
x1 <- "El Ni\xf1o was particularly bad this year"
x2 <- "\x82\xb1\x82\xf1\x82\xc9\x82\xbf\x82\xcd"
# we fix this by specifying encoding
parse_character(x1, locale = locale(encoding = "Latin1"))
parse_character(x2, locale = locale(encoding = "Shift-JIS"))
# how do you find the right encoding? - use gues_encoding() to try different encodings till you find the right one
guess_encoding(charToRaw(x1))
guess_encoding(charToRaw(x2))

# Factors ----
fruit <- c("apple", "banana")
parse_factor(c("apple", "banana", "apple"), levels = fruit)
# Dates, Date-Time, and Times ----
# parse_datetime() expects an ISO8601 date-time  - an international standard where components of a date are arranged from lagest to smallest: year to second
parse_datetime("2018-09-24T2018")
#parse_date() expects a four-digit year, a - or /, the month, a - or /, then the day
parse_date("2018/09/24")
# parse_time() expects the hour, :, minutes, optionally : and seconds, and an optional a.m/p.m. specifier
parse_time("01:10 am")
d1 <- "January 1, 2010"
d2 <- "2015-Mar-07"
d3 <- "06-Jun-2017"
d4 <- c("August 19 (2015)", "July 1 (2015)")
d5 <- "12/30/14" 
t1 <- "1705"
t2 <- "11:15:10.12 PM"
parse_date(d1,"%B %d, %Y")

parse_date(d4,"%B %d (%Y)")
parse_date(d5, "%m/%d/%y")

parse_time(t2, "%H:%M:%OS %p")

# Reading and writing files with `readr` ----
challenge <- read_csv(readr_example("challenge.csv"))
problems(challenge) # it is a good idea to explicitly pull out the problems
# a good strategy is to work col by col until there are no problems remaining
# start by copying and pasting the col specification into your original call
challenge <- read_csv(readr_example("challenge.csv"), col_types = cols(x = col_integer(),y = col_character()))
challenge <- read_csv(readr_example("challenge.csv"),col_types =  cols(x = col_double(), y = col_character())) # fixes the first problem
tail(challenge) # we see col y which should be date stored as character
challenge <- read_csv(readr_example("challenge.csv"), col_types = cols(x = col_double(), y = col_date()))
# sometimes it's easier to diagnose prolems by reading in all cols as char vectors
challenge2 <- read_csv(readr_example("challenge.csv"), col_types = cols(.default = col_character())) # which is useful in conjuction with `type_convert()`
df <- tribble(~x,~y,"1","1.21","2","2.32","3","4.56")
df
type_convert(df)
```
## Tidy Data with tidyr
```{r}
# Gathering ----
# to gather, we need 
#1) the set of columns that represent values, not variables
#2) the name of the variable whose values form the column names, the key
#3) the name of the variable whose values are spread over the cells, the value
table4a # has cols 1999 and 2000 that need gathering
table4a %>% gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
table4b # needs gathering as well
table4b %>% gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "population")
# you may combine two tidied versions using `dplyr::left_join()
tidy4a <- table4a %>% gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
tidy4b <- table4b %>% gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "population")
left_join(tidy4a, tidy4b) #or
right_join(tidy4a, tidy4b)

# Spreading ----
#used when an obs is scattered accross multiple rows
table2 # each obs is spread across multiple rows
# we spread when we have 
#1) the column that contains variable names, the key column, here it's type
#2) the column that contains values from multiple variables, the value column, here it's count
spread(table2, key = "type", value = "count")

# Separating and Pulling ----
# `separate()` ----

# `separate()` pulls apart  one column into multiple columns, by splitting wherever a separator character appears.
table3
table3 %>% separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/")
# `separate()` leaves the type of column as is. We can use `convert = TRUE` to ask separator to convert the cols to better types
table3 %>% separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/", convert = T)
# separating last 2 digits of each year
table3 %>% separate(year, into = c("centuary", "year"), sep = 2)

# Unite ----
# `unite()` is the inverse of `separate()`
table5
table5 %>% unite(new, century, year, sep = "") %>% separate(rate, into = c("cases","pop"), sep = "/", convert = T) #default sep is "_"
# Missing values ----
#1) missing explicitly - flagged with NA
#2) Missing implicitly - simply not present in the data
stocks <- tibble(year = c(rep(2015, times = 4),rep(2016, times = 3)), qtr = c(1:4, 2:4), return = c(1.88, .59, .35, NA, .92, .17, 2.66))
stocks
stocks %>% spread(year, return) %>% gather(year, return, `2015`:`2016`, na.rm = T) # removing missing values
stocks %>% complete(year, qtr) # fills in explicit NAs
treatment <- tribble(~person, ~treatment, ~response,
                     "Derrick Dee", 1, 7, NA, 2, 10, NA, 3, 9, "Katherine Burke", 1, 4)
treatment %>% fill(person) 
# case study -- TB data ----
who.tb <- read_csv("C:\\Users\\admin\\Analysis\\WHOtb_data_analysis\\data\\TB_burden_countries_2018-07-04.csv", col_names = T, trim_ws = T, guess_max = 1001)
who.tb<-as.tibble(who.tb) %>% glimpse()
View(who.tb)
who.tb %>% mutate(year = parse_date(year, format = "%Y")) %>% View()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
