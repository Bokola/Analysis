I crowdsourced interest using the R4DS Slack and the results were magical: a group of incredibly curious and generous people motivated to learn and teach one another emerged. The meetings evolved from a group of strangers giving timid presentations to a safe space where we share and improve upon personal applications. The 1 club has grown to 3 regional cohorts, and became a model for discussing other books too. This talk will go over the structure of our meetings in hopes of empowering others to start their own book clubs, showcasing a different way people can create and engage in communities.</p>

However, when it comes to complex, multi-paneled plots, users rely on 3rd party graphic design software to arrange plots. Here I present the new world of programmatic, coordinate-based multi-figure plotting in R. Employing grid Graphics and drawing from the paradigms of base plotting and ggplot2, I am developing a package that will revolutionize the way plots are laid out in R. Not only will individual plots be aesthetically customizable and tailored for speed, users will also be offered exquisite control over all aspects of page layout, plot placement, and arrangements.

between these stages occur.
I'll discuss the type of support required for R users to move from one level of expertise to the next,
and how different types of training and documentation can support R users at each level.
Understanding variable levels of education among R practitioners supports our own professional work,
from collaborative coding to package development,
and helps build a bigger, more inclusive R community.</p>
","How does someone make the leap from learning R to actively applying R in professional work?
At what point (if ever!) do we get to call ourselves ""experts"" in R?
This talk explores what differentiates novice, practitioner, and expert R programmers,
and how transitions
between these stages occur.
I'll discuss the type of support required for R users to move from one level of expertise to the next,
and how different types of training and documentation can support R users at each level.
Understanding variable levels of education among R practitioners supports our own professional work,
from collaborative coding to package development,
and helps build a bigger, more inclusive R community.

In language teaching, this is called a “communicative approach”, and is based on the idea that learning a language successfully comes through having to communicate real meaning to real people. This is what I expected to find when I first tried to learn R seven years ago. Sadly, I got stuck in resources that started with definitions of abstract concepts and no real examples of how to say things with data. In this talk I will discuss the benefits of adopting a communicative approach and how to implement it when teaching/learning R, writing documentation, and writing code that will be read by other human beings.</p>

","When building a predictive model in R, many of the functions (such as lm(), glm(), randomForest, xgboost, or neural networks in keras) require that all input variables are numeric.  If your data has categorical variables, you may have to choose between ignoring some of your data and too many new columns.

Categorical embeddings are a relative new method, utilizing methods popularized in Natural Language Processing that help models solve this problem and can help you understand more about the categories themselves.

In particular, styles for HTML content (e.g., <code>actionButton()</code>, <code>tabsetPanel()</code>, <code>titlePanel()</code>, etc) derive from Bootstrap CSS, so customization is traditionally done by overwriting that CSS, which is difficult to do 100% correctly. The <code>{bslib}</code> package helps solve this problem by making it easy to customize (any version of) Bootstrap CSS defaults from R. However, this only solves part of the problem since CSS doesn't necessarily effect output(s) rendered by R, such as <code>plotOutput()</code>. The thematic package helps solve this problem by providing auto theming of <code>plotOutput()</code>s (based on CSS) as well as a simple interface for styling any R graphic for any output format.</p>

","Last January I left my job to spend a year developing siuba, a python port of dplyr. At its core, this decision was driven by a decade of watching python and R users produce similar analyses, but in very different ways.

This talk will explain why this false choice exists, debunk the myths that cause teams to be stuck with only one tool, and clarify how data scientists can use both languages to be more effective. We will explore this love story's blossoming relationship by looking at updates to RStudio's packages and products that make it easier to develop and collaborate in R and Python. This talk is for individuals who want to uncover the benefits of multilingual data science, IT professionals who are skeptical their life can get better by supporting more languages, and data science managers interested in enabling their teams instead of forcing their data superheros to be subservient to particular tools.</p>

Mike Page",Cognitive speed: How the Tidyverse helped the British Red Cross respond quickly to COVID-19,2021-01-22T15:19:19Z,734,"<p>We will discuss the importance of cognitive speed, defined here as the rate in which an idea can be translated into code, and why the Tidyverse excels in this domain. We will demonstrate this idea in relation to a suite of tools we were required to rapidly develop at the British Red Cross in order to respond effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic. To do this, we will exhibit how elements of the unifying design principles outlined in the ‘tidyverse design guide - Tidyverse team’ relate to the notion of cognitive speed, giving specific examples for various design considerations. We believe this talk will encourage reflection on better design practices for future R developers, using the design principles of the tidyverse as the guiding beacon.</p>

In particular, styles for HTML content (e.g., <code>actionButton()</code>, <code>tabsetPanel()</code>, <code>titlePanel()</code>, etc) derive from Bootstrap CSS, so customization is traditionally done by overwriting that CSS, which is difficult to do 100% correctly. The <code>{bslib}</code> package helps solve this problem by making it easy to customize (any version of) Bootstrap CSS defaults from R. However, this only solves part of the problem since CSS doesn't necessarily effect output(s) rendered by R, such as <code>plotOutput()</code>.

293,talk,lima,C,Programming,Aaron Jacobs,Introducing xrprof: A New Way to Profile R,2021-01-22T14:00:00Z,1094,"<p>Tracking down performance issues in R code usually means using R's built-in <code>Rprof()</code> profiler or one of the packages built around it. But the changing nature of the R community (towards more deployed applications) makes local profiling workflows frustrating, which is why I have written a new profiler: xrprof.</p>
<p>xprof is compatible with existing R tools, but unlike them it can be used to profile R code that is already running -- in fact, it is designed to be safe to point at R code running &quot;in production&quot;. xrprof also works seamlessly when R is run inside Docker, and can even be run in complex environments like Kubernetes clusters.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from the {jointprof} package, xrprof can also show function calls at the C/C++ level alongside those from R. This can be immensely useful for diagnosing problems in packages that make heavy use of compiled code.</p>

xprof is compatible with existing R tools, but unlike them it can be used to profile R code that is already running -- in fact, it is designed to be safe to point at R code running ""in production"". xrprof also works seamlessly when R is run inside Docker, and can even be run in complex environments like Kubernetes clusters.

Taking inspiration from the {jointprof} package, xrprof can also show function calls at the C/C++ level alongside those from R. This can be immensely useful for diagnosing problems in packages that make heavy use of compiled code.
