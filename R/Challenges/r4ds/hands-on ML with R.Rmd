```

We cover:

* Generalized low rank models
* Clustering algorithms
* Autoencoders
* Regularized models
* Random forests
* Gradient boosting machines
* Deep neural networks
* Stacking / super learner
* and more

We'll be using `glmnet`, `h20`, `ranger`, `xgboost` and `lime` packages.
So why R? The usefulness of R for data science can be attributed to its large and active ecosystem of third party packages: `tidyverse` for common data analysis activities; `h20`, `ranger`, `xgboost`, and more for scalable ML; `lime`, `pdp`, `DALEX`, and more for ML interpretability and much more that's not mentioned here.

First, we install packages:

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE}
ipk <- function(pkg) {
  new.pkg <- list.of.pkgs[!(list.of.pkgs %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
  if(length(new.pkg)) install.packages(new.pkg,  dependencies = T)
  sapply(pkg, require, character.only = T)
}
# packages used
list.of.pkgs <- c("AmesHousing", "caret", "data.table", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "gbm", "glmnet", "h2o", "pdp",  "pROC", "purrr", "ranger", "ROCR", "rsample", "vip", "xgboost", "Rcpp")
ipk(list.of.pkgs)
# package and session info
sessionInfo()
```

# **Chapter 1 Introduction **
The importance of ML can never be understated. Example application areas include:

  * predicting the likelihood of a patient returning to     the hospital (readmission) within 30 days of            discharge,
  * segmenting customers based on common attributes or      purchasing habits for target marketing,
  * predicting coupon redemption rates for a given          marketing campaign,
  * and much more.
The underpinning principle is that all ML tasks seek to learn from data. To address each question, we use a given set of *features* to train an algorithm and extract insights. The algorithms may be classified with regards to amount/type of *supervision* employed during training. Two main groups: ***supervised learners *** that are used to construct predictive models, and ***unsupervised learners*** that are used to build descriptive models. The type you will need to use depends on the task you hope to accomplish.

## **Supervised Learning **

A ***predictive model** is used for tasks that involve the prediction of a given output using other variables and their values (*features*) in the data set. It entails buliding mathematical models/tools that accurately predict an outcome. The learning algorithm in predictive models attempts to discover and model the relationship among the *target* response (the predicate) and other features (predictors)
Examples of predictive modelling include:

  * using customer attributes to predict the probability     of the customer churning in six weeks,
  * using home attributes to predict the sales price,
  * using employee attributes to predict the likelihood     of   attrition, etc.
Each of these examples have a defined learning task. They each intend to use attributes (***X***) to predict an outcome (***Y***).
The examples above describe *supervised learning*. The supervision refers to the fact that the target values provide a supervisory role, which indicates to the learner the task it needs to learn. Specifically given a set of data, the learning algorithm attempts to optimize a function (the algorithmic steps) to find the combination of feature values that result in a predicted value that is as close to the actual target output as possible.
In supervised learning, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions. Consequently, the solutions can be used to help *supervise* the training process to find the optimal algorithm parameters ( in terms of bias and model variance)
Supervised learning problems can be further classified into regression and classification tasks

### **Regression problems**
Predictions involving numeric outcome (should not be confused with linear regression modelling)

### **Classification Problems**
Involves predicting a categorical response. Revolve around predicting a binary or multinomial response measure such as:

* did a redeem a coupon (yes/no, 1/0),
* did a customer churn
* did a customer click on our online ad
* classifying customer reviews:
    * binary: positive vis-a-vis negative
    * multinomial: extremely negative to extremely            positive on a 0-5 Likert scale
When we apply an ML algorithm to a classification problem, we often predict the probability of a particular class (i.e yes: 65, no:35) rather than prdicting a particular class (i.e., "yes" or "no")

## **Unsupervised Learning**

***Unsupervised learning***, unlike supervised learning includes a set of tools to better understand and describe your data but performs the analysis without a target variable. In essence, unsupervised learning is concerned with identifying groups in a dataset. The groups may be defined by the rows (i.e., *clustering*) or by the columns (i.e., *dimension reduction*).

In ***clustering***, observations are segmented into similar groups based on observed variables. An example is dividing consumers into homogenous groups (market segmentation). In ***dimension reduction***, the task is to reduce the number of variables in a data set. For example, classical regression models break down in the presence of highly correlated features. Dimension reduction techniques attempt to reduce the feature set to a potentially smaller set of uncorrelated variables. 
Unsupervised learning is usually done as part of exploratory data analysis.

### **The data sets**

  * *features*: 80
  * *access*: provided by `AmesHousing` package
  * *more details*: see `?AmesHousing::ames_raw`

2. Employee attrition information
