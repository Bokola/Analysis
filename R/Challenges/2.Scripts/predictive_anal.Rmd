```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
options(max.print = 1000000)
```
This script is me trying to learn predictive analytics using R

```{r packages}
ipk <- function(pkg) {
  new.pkg<-list.of.pkgs[! list.of.pkgs %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"]]
  if(length(new.pkg)) install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = T)
  sapply(pkg, require,character.only=T)
}
list.of.pkgs<-c("tidyverse","yardstick","caret")
ipk(list.of.pkgs)
```
### Visualize
```{r graphing}
glimpse(mtcars)
ggplot(mtcars,aes(x=mpg)) + geom_histogram() + labs(y="Number of vehicles",x="mpg")


```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
